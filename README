LGPL v3 by Kurt Schwehr

This is a reference implementation of the AIS Binary Messages
described in the IMO Circular 289 specification:

  IMO, Guidance on the Use of AIS Application-Specific Messages, IMO,
  SN.1/Circ.289, Ref. T2-OSS/2.7.1, 2 June 2010.

This library started for just the area notice (aka Zone) to support
the Rightwhale AIS Project (RAP).  Since then, the project is trying
to include the other messages defined in that document to help create
a free and public test set of messages to support other software
projects.
